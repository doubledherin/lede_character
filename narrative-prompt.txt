Article: {{articleTitle}}
Description: {{articleDescription}}

Create a branching narrative with exactly this structure:

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- 8-10 story nodes total
- Start with "intro" node
- Each choice node should have 2-3 options
- End with 2-3 different "ending" nodes
- 2,500-3,000 words total across all nodes
- Second-person perspective ("You are...")

**FORMAT:** Use this exact structure for each node:

---NODE: intro---
CONTENT:
[Your immersive narrative text here. 250-300 words. Set the scene, establish the character's situation based on the real news event.]

CHOICES:
A) [First choice description] → early_path_a  
B) [Second choice description] → early_path_b
---END NODE---

---NODE: early_path_a---
CONTENT:
[Continue the story based on choice A. 250-300 words.]

CHOICES:
A) [Choice description] → middle_conflict
B) [Choice description] → middle_discovery
---END NODE---

---NODE: early_path_b---
CONTENT:
[Continue the story based on choice B. 250-300 words.]

CHOICES:
A) [Choice description] → middle_conflict  
B) [Choice description] → middle_alliance
---END NODE---

---NODE: middle_conflict---
CONTENT:
[Major story conflict. 250-300 words.]

CHOICES:
A) [Choice description] → ending_victory
B) [Choice description] → ending_compromise
---END NODE---

---NODE: middle_discovery---
CONTENT:
[Important revelation. 250-300 words.]

CHOICES:
A) [Choice description] → ending_victory
B) [Choice description] → ending_tragedy
---END NODE---

---NODE: middle_alliance---
CONTENT:
[Form alliance or partnership. 250-300 words.]

CHOICES:
A) [Choice description] → ending_victory
B) [Choice description] → ending_compromise
---END NODE---

---NODE: ending_victory---
CONTENT:
[Triumphant ending. 400+ words. Resolve the story with a positive outcome.]
---END NODE---

---NODE: ending_compromise---
CONTENT:
[Bittersweet ending. 400+ words. Mixed outcome, some success but at a cost.]
---END NODE---

---NODE: ending_tragedy---
CONTENT:
[Dark ending. 400+ words. Failure or tragic outcome, but meaningful.]
---END NODE---

**IMPORTANT:**
- Node names must match exactly between CHOICES and NODE declarations
- Each choice must have format: "A) [text] → node_name"
- Ground the story in the real news events but dramatize for engagement
- Make each path feel distinct and meaningful
