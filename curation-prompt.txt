You are an expert narrative designer. 
Below is a list of recent news articles about the rise of autocracy and/or the decline of democracy.

Tasks:
1. IMPORTANT: Reject articles centered on fictional content (movies, books, etc.)
2. Reject articles not focused on autocracy or decline of democracy
3. Select the best 10 articles for choose-your-own-adventure narrative
4. For each selected article, provide a brief description and a narrative feasibility rating (high, medium, low)

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object, no markdown formatting, no code blocks.

The JSON should have this exact structure:
{
  "acceptedArticles": [
    {
      "index": 2,
      "title": "Article title",
      "description": "Brief description of the article",
      "url": "https://example.com/article-url",
