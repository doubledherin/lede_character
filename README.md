# Lede Character

This is a WIP; expect the README and codebase to be updated frequently.

## Overview

An AI-powered immersive journalism platform that transforms real news about democracy's decline into interactive, audio-driven choose-your-own-adventure narratives. Using OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent news curation and narrative generation, with a graph-based story structure designed for future audio integration via ElevenLabs APIs.

Key Features:

- AI-Powered Pipeline: GPT-4 curates news and generates branching narratives
- Graph-Based Story Engine: Sophisticated node-and-choice structure for complex branching
- Interactive Menu System: Browse and select stories from an intuitive CLI interface
- Terminal-Based Gameplay: Full choose-your-own-adventure experience with branching narratives
- Real News Foundation: Stories grounded in actual democracy/autocracy reporting
- Scalable Architecture: Built for future audio synthesis and voice interaction

### Current Implementation:

1. News Curation: Fetch and intelligently filter articles about autocracy and democratic decline
2. Story Generation: Transform selected articles into branching interactive narratives
3. Graph Storage: Save stories as interconnected nodes and choices in SQLite database
4. Interactive Story Browser: Menu-driven interface to select and play available narratives
5. Complete MVP: End-to-end pipeline from news article to playable interactive story on the command line

### Planned Features:

- **Daily Automation**: Built-in cron job support for automated daily processing
- **Audio Integration**: Use ElevenLabs APIs to generate professional voice narration and sound effects
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based story player with enhanced UX
- **Session Management**: Track user progress, choices, and story completion
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart caching and cost tracking for API usage

The end goal is a fully immersive audio experience where users can select from curated news-based narratives, make choices at decision points, and experience branching storylines with professional voice acting and atmospheric sound design.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ (for built-in fetch support)
- npm or yarn package manager
- NewsAPI account and API key
- OpenAI account and API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd lede_character
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install sqlite3 dotenv
```

3. Get your API keys:

   - **NewsAPI**: Sign up at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) for a free API key
   - **OpenAI**: Get your API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

5. Initialize the DB:
   This will happen on the first run.

## Usage

### Interactive Story Browser (Recommended)

```bash
# Browse and play available narratives with menu selection
node chooseAndPlay.js
```

This launches an interactive menu where you can:

- View all available narratives with descriptions
- See which news articles each story is based on
- Select stories by number for immediate playback
- Return to the menu after completing stories
- Play multiple stories in one session

### Full MVP Demo

```bash
# Complete pipeline: fetch â†’ curate â†’ generate â†’ play
node mvpDemo.js
```

### Step by Step Usage

1. **Fetch and Curate Articles**

```bash
node main.js
```

- Fetches recent articles about democracy/autocracy
- Uses GPT-4 to curate the most narrative-worthy stories
- Saves results to SQLite database

2. **Generate Interactive Narratives**

```bash
node generateNarrative.js <articleId>
# Example: node generateNarrative.js 1
```

- Creates a branching choose-your-own-adventure story
- Uses graph structure with story nodes and choice connections
- Stores narrative as interconnected database entities

3. **Play Specific Story by Article ID**

```bash
node playNarrative.js <articleId>
# Example: node playNarrative.js 1
```

- Interactive terminal-based story experience
- Navigate through branching narrative with numbered choices
- Multiple endings based on user decisions

### Batch Narrative Generation

```bash
# Generate narratives for all articles without existing narratives
node generateAllNarratives.js

# Skip confirmation prompt for large batches
node generateAllNarratives.js --confirm
```

**Features:**

- **Smart Article Detection**: Finds articles without existing narratives using LEFT JOIN queries
- **Cost Estimation**: Shows estimated OpenAI costs before proceeding with batch operations
- **Rate Limit Handling**: 2-second delays between requests to respect OpenAI API limits
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows current progress (e.g., [3/10]) and reports success/failure rates
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing if individual articles fail, with detailed reporting
- **Batch Confirmation**: Prompts for confirmation on expensive operations (5+ narratives)

This is especially useful after running `node main.js` to quickly generate interactive stories for all your curated articles.

## Database

The application uses SQLite to store analysis runs, articles, and generated narratives with automatic schema creation.

## Cost Considerations

**GPT-4 Turbo Pricing (as of 2025):**

- Input: $0.01 per 1K tokens
- Output: $0.03 per 1K tokens
- **Typical cost per analysis run**: ~$0.05-0.15 (depends on article count)
- **Typical cost per narrative**: ~$0.13
- **Daily automation estimate**: ~$1-3/day (varies by news volume)

## Monitoring and Logging

The application provides detailed logging:

- Article fetching progress and counts
- AI analysis results and acceptance rates
- Database operations and run tracking
- Narrative generation status
- Interactive story session tracking
- Error handling with specific failure points

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Missing environment variables
- API request failures and rate limits
- Database connection issues
- Duplicate narrative prevention
- Invalid article IDs and narrative selection
- Malformed AI responses
- User input validation in interactive menus

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"database is locked"**

- Close DB Browser for SQLite before running scripts
- Ensure no other processes are accessing the database

**"No narratives available" in chooseAndPlay.js**

- Run `node main.js` to fetch and curate articles
- Run `node generateAllNarratives.js` to create narratives
- Check database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM narratives`

**"Article not found" in playNarrative.js**

- Check that the article ID exists: `SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id = ?`
- Use `node chooseAndPlay.js` instead for easier story selection

**Double input or readline issues**

- Only one Node.js process should access the terminal at a time
- Use `node chooseAndPlay.js` for the best interactive experience

**Short narratives despite prompt requirements**

- Check max_tokens setting (should be 4096)
- Verify narrative-prompt.txt emphasizes length requirements

**NewsAPI returns fake URLs**

- This is normal for paywalled content
- The application automatically filters these out

### Rate Limits

Be aware of the following API rate limits with the current implementation:

- **NewsAPI**: 1,000 requests/month (free tier)
- **OpenAI**: Varies by plan and model

## Development

### Testing

```bash
# Test article fetching
node -e "require('./helpers').getRecentArticles().then(console.log)"

# Test database operations
node -e "require('./helpers').getMostRecentAnalysisRunTimestamp().then(console.log)"

# Test narrative generation
node generateNarrative.js <article_id>

# Test interactive experience
node chooseAndPlay.js
```
